This repository contains my solutions for [Assignment 3](https://github.com/visual-learning/transformers/tree/0810e29a8513b4b0a9ce6c3249bbbdb520b49b5c) from the course **16-824: Visual Learning and Recognition** offered in Spring 2024 at Carnegie Mellon University.

Most of the dependencies can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can also install them manually using the following commands:

`pip install torch numpy==1.23.0 h5py imageio matplotlib`

# Usage

Follow the instructions in the READMEs of the respective directories [`transformers_captioning/`](https://github.com/LongVanTH/Transformers-and-ViT/tree/main/transformer_captioning) and [`vit_classification/`](https://github.com/LongVanTH/Transformers-and-ViT/tree/main/vit_classification) to run the code (simply run `run.py`).
